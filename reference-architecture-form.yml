# GRUNTWORK REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE SETUP FORM
# The following information is used to generate your reference architecture.
# Read all the TODO items, and make sure to update the text in every field where it says replace-me.
#
# IMPORTANT: YAML files are space-sensitive. Be sure to retain the indentation associated with each field
# or the form will not parse correctly.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#############################################################################################################
# INITIAL INFORMATION FIELDS
# The fields in this section are used for basic information gathering about the deployment.
#############################################################################################################
#
# TODO: Enter the name of your organization. This will be used to generate a prefix name for every resource.
# Example:
#   CompanyName: "gruntwork"
CompanyName: "gwrc"

# TODO: Enter the primary AWS region where you want to deploy the Reference Architecture.
# You can always add more regions to your architecture later by following the patterns from this initial deployment.
# Example:
#   PrimaryRegion: "us-east-1"
PrimaryRegion: "ap-southeast-2"

# TODO: Enter the https URL to your infrastructure-live repository
# Example:
#   InfraLiveRepoURL: "https://github.com/your-company/infrastructure-live.git"
InfraLiveRepoURL: "https://github.com/Greater-Wellington-Regional-Council/Environmental-Outcomes-Platform-Infrastructure.git"

# TODO: Enter the ssh URL to the infrastructure-live repository
# Example:
#   InfraLiveRepoSSHURL: "git@github.com:your-company/infrastructure-live.git"
InfraLiveRepoSSHURL: "git@github.com:Greater-Wellington-Regional-Council/Environmental-Outcomes-Platform-Infrastructure.git"

# TODO: Confirm the default branch setting of your infrastructure-live repository.
# The default branch of the infrastructure-live repository. This branch is the only branch that the Gruntwork Pipelines
# solution will be allowed to deploy from. This branch should be marked as protected by your VCS platform.
# If you are unfamiliar with protected branches, you can review the following documentation:
#
#   GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches
#   GitLab: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html
#   Bitbucket: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-branch-permissions/
#
# We recommend using "main" as the name of the default branch. If you already have a specially configured branch you want to use
# that is not "main" you can create a copy of it by running `git checkout -b main`.
#
# Your CI/CD integration will use this branch as the production branch, meaning that
# 1. This branch will reflect what is deployed and running in production at any given time
# 2. CI/CD will run `terragrunt apply` against this whenever you merge changes into it (from development or feature branches)
# 3. Feature branches that are pushed such as developer-test-feature-1 will have terragrunt plan run against them
#
# Example:
#   InfraLiveDefaultBranchName: "main"
InfraLiveDefaultBranchName: "main"

# AWS INFORMATION FIELDS
# The fields in this section are used for connecting to and configuring the AWS accounts.
#############################################################################################################

# The list of usernames for IAM users who are considered admins in your org. We will generate IAM Users and access
# credentials for each user in the list and email the pgp encrypted login profile. You must provide at least one user,
# or you will not be able to access the AWS accounts!
AdminIAMUsers:
  # Replicate the info below for each user you would like to create an admin IAM user for.
  # NOTE: The first in the list will be used to generate documentation.
  # NOTE: You must ensure that EACH user you specify here has BOTH:
  # 1. A Keybase account (https://keybase.io) with the exact same name
  # 2. A PGP key associated with the keybase account
  # TODO: Update the username of the IAM user, the email address for sending credentials, and the PGP key to use.
  # Example:
  #   - Username: "grunty"
  #     Email: "grunty@gruntwork.io"

#                                   AWS Cloudtrail).
# - security (Required, Singleton): The account where IAM users are defined. This acts as the bastion entrypoint into
#                                   your AWS architecture (e.g., to access dev account, you would login to security and
#                                   assume a new role in the dev account).
# - shared   (Required, Singleton): The account where shared resources are defined. This includes AMIs and Docker
#                                   Container Images.
